 1. From scratch, I wrote two classes called Queue and QueueNode. QueueNode is basically just
 a Node class specifically meant for Queue. The Queue class is a First-In, First-Out Data Structure
 to organize the animals that are waiting to join the sanctuary. Queue utilizes Nodes to keep track of
 data in order. Since it utilizes Nodes, it is possible to store any type of data in the Queues.

 2. In the AnimalSanctuary class, I created a queue of Strings that holds data that is enqueued when
 the sanctuary is full. When a spot opens up (an animal is removed), the queue is checked before marking
 the spot as "Empty." If there is an available animal in the queue, the animal's String is dequeued,
 and the spot is filled.

 3. I made an animation such that whenever the user adds a new animal, an animal image
 runs/moves into the square where the animal has just been added. If the user
 decides to remove the animal, the animal disappears.

 4. Moreover, when a new animal is added in it's place, it's animation runs quicker towards
 the square (as if it is excited to be able to finally enter the sanctuary).

 5. I also programmed the "input health" TextField such that it only allows
 the single-digit numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The user is unable to type other
 characters/numbers into the TextField.

 6. I made the title "The Animal Sanctuary" get bigger when the user hovers over it.
